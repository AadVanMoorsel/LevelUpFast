    text: <b>Level Up Fast</b> is a grass-roots effort in digital upskilling for <b>Covid recovery</b>. Brought to you by colleges, universities and other digital skills providers from North East England.

LevelUpFast is a grass roots coalition of education and training providers, including universities and colleges. The group is supported by National Innovation Centre for Data, Sunderland Software City and the NELEP. 

It is our intention to identify immediate and urgent gaps in digital skills and to work together, with the broader community, to identify how those gaps might be filled quickly in order to support recovery from the Covid crisis. It's not our plan to create new programmes but to collate and publicise information on existing offers, although our work will inevitably inform future, long-term upskilling, programmes. 

Each month we will work with interested parties, via a roundtable meeting and other interactions, to identify urgent skills needs. In consultation, the LevelUpFast team will choose one theme and then collate information from providers of training and education, along with online resources. The results will be disseminated within two months through our websites and via a speed talk event.
